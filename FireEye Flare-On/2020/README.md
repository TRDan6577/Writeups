# Flare-on 2020
This was my first reverse engineering capture the flag.

The results can be found [here](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/10/flare-on-7-challenge-solutions.html). Overall, I was one of 817 people to complete 6 challenges out of the 5,648 contestants registered (top 15%)

# Disclaimer
I did not write the challenge files (the files included in this directory with the .7z file extension). These were written by the amazing authors at Flare-on. These files should _ONLY_ be opened in a lab or VM that's designed for malware analysis. The password for all of these files is `flare`.
